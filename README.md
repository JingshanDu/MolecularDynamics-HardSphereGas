# MolecularDynamics-HardSphereGas
A MATLAB program for Molecular Dynamics simulation of a gas of molecules as hard spheres.

A simple MD simulation of a gas of molecules written in Matlab (2010b tested)

All molecules are assumed as hard spheres. Initial status: random uniformly distributed position and velocity. Simple searching (traversal). Periodic boundary conditions were considered, but collision after crossing the boundaries at a step was ignored.

Might be kind of limited, because this is only part of a college coursework.
